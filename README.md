# Check-Insta-followers-list

This code was written in order to figure out the name/ IDs of people whom you are following on Insta. Some people follow you and when you follow you back then unfollow you. That's how they get more followers. 

Here in the following.txt file paste the link of all the people whom you are following and in the followers.txt put all the followers of yours. 
To copy the list just simply go to Instagram webpage and click on Followiing/ Followers and manually drag with mouse and copy them. 

It was a product of free time. Hope you like it.
